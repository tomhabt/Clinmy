            <h2>But We Have to Agree on Something</h2>
            <h3>Cleaning Service Policy</h3>
            <p><strong>Background</strong><br>
            A. The Client is of the opinion that the Contractor has the necessary qualifications, experience, and abilities to provide cleaning services to the Client.<br>
            B. The Contractor is agreeable to providing such cleaning services to the Client on the terms and conditions set out in this Policy.<br>
            In consideration of the matters described above and of the mutual benefits and obligations set forth in this Policy, the receipt and sufficiency of which consideration is hereby acknowledged, the Client and the Contractor (individually the "Party" and collectively the "Parties" to this Policy) agree as follows:</p>
            <h3>Ontario Consumer Protection Act, 2002</h3>
            <p>1. Consumer rights as outlined in the Ontario Consumer Protection Act, 2002 can be found at the end of this Policy in Appendix A.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Our Obligations</h2>
            <h3>Services Provided</h3>
            <p>2. The Client hereby agrees to engage the Contractor to provide the Client with the following cleaning services (the "Services"): Clean vehicle interior including but not limited to seats, dashboards and compartments, side windows, and mats, with schedule set by both parties as stated above.<br>
            3. The venue for delivery of the Services is: client's designated spot (mostly their home parking).<br>
            4. The time for delivery of the Services is: As Scheduled.<br>
            5. The Services will also include any other cleaning tasks which the Parties may agree on. The Contractor hereby agrees to provide such Services to the Client with or without additional fees.<br>
            6. The Client is guaranteed by the service of the Contractor to the level of its satisfaction. The Client is addressing all the need for freshness in their vehicle’s interior and is committed to adding value to the clean level. If the Client is not satisfied with the value added to its vehicle cleanliness, the Contractor guarantees a re-clean up promised until it reaches a satisfaction level.</p>
            <h3>Performance</h3>
            <p>7. The Parties agree to do everything necessary to ensure that the terms of this Policy take effect.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Your Obligations</h2>
            <h3>Access, Provisions by the Customer and Personal Belongings</h3>
            <h3>Access</h3>
            <p>8. The service is planned to be executed under the best comfort of the client. It is believed that such service will save time and money for the customer beyond the hustle to properly keep car hygiene and in good shape. While performing (the “service”) we try to eliminate the involvement of the client during service operation. The Motto of our service is to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Let your car have a long life inside,</li>
                <li>Keep your vehicle clean and stylish at most times,</li>
                <li>Save your time hustling to clean your interior with less availability of such services in the town,</li>
                <li>Save you money costing for occasional detailing, routine car wash and rushed vacuuming,</li>
                <li>Let the customer satisfy every time when they go to work, shopping and throughout their vehicle usage.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>9. Based on your schedule, this Policy is formed to let the contractor come to you, access your car, and perform the cleaning service. Your availability is a requirement for the service.</p>
            <h3>Personal Belongings and Free Up Working Spots</h3>
            <p>10. The contractor is entitled to operate in a safe, responsible, and satisfactory way throughout the service. The Contractor values every item that the client leaves in their vehicle. It is highly appreciated to eliminate personal belongings away from the detailing area mentioned above in the “service” section. All valuable items should be totally removed from the vehicle during operation and the contractor is not liable for any vandalized valuable items.<br>
            11. It is absolutely the obligation of the client to remove all blocking items away from seats, the floor, the cup holding areas, and put them in the trunk. All hindering items (children car seats and boosters are excepted) will not be moved by the contractor and the contractor is not responsible for cleaning the areas under obstacles.</p>
            <h3>Compensation</h3>
            <p>12. The Contractor will charge the Client for the Services at the rate of range of *AS DETAILED IN THE PACKAGE* depending on the type of car or service type chosen (the "Compensation").<br>
            13. Cash transactions are NOT part of our Policy. All payments are made by Interac only including Debit, Visa, MasterCard, and American Express.<br>
            14. The Client will be invoiced as soon as the service is completed unless specified.<br>
            15. Invoices submitted by the Contractor to the Client are due within 30 days of receipt if post payment is chosen.<br>
            16. The Client will see a payment processed by a Third-party point of sale from companies/platforms called “SquareUp” and/or “Setmore”, well-known and trusted payment transactional and booking companies respectively. We have been customers with those companies/platforms since the year 2019 and the contractor hopes to continue using the platform as the service goes on for the coming few years. There is no charge to the Client for using this platform, all the fees are covered by the Contractor. The Client will be notified in writing if anything changes.<br>
            17. The Compensation as stated in this Policy does not include sales tax, or other applicable duties as may be required by law. Any sales tax and duties required by law will be charged to the Client in addition to the Compensation.<br>
            18. The Contractor will not be reimbursed for any expenses incurred in connection with providing the Services of this Policy.</p>
            <h3>Interest on Late Payments</h3>
            <p>19. Interest payable on any overdue amounts under this Policy is charged at a rate of 1.50% per annum or at the maximum rate enforceable under applicable legislation, whichever is lower.</p>
            <h3>Tipping</h3>
            <p>20. Our policy strictly mandates that tipping is only available through our payment platform. The overall service is a NON-cash interaction.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
            <p>21. Confidential information (the "Confidential Information") refers to any data or information relating to the Client, whether business or personal, which would reasonably be considered to be private or proprietary to the Client and that is not generally known and where the release of that Confidential Information could reasonably be expected to cause harm to the Client.<br>
            22. The Contractor agrees that they will not disclose, divulge, reveal, report, or use, for any purpose, any Confidential Information which the Contractor has obtained, except as authorized by the Client or as required by law.

            <h3>Equipment</h3>
            <p>26. Except as otherwise provided in this Policy, the Contractor will provide at the Contractor's own expense, any and all equipment, accessories, chemicals, solvents, cleaning fluids, workwear, and any other supplies necessary to deliver the Services in accordance with the Policy.</p>
            <h3>No Exclusivity</h3>
            <p>27. The Parties acknowledge that this Policy is non-exclusive and that either Party will be free, during and after the Term, to engage or contract with third parties for the provision of services similar to the Services.</p>
